In Django, "views" refer to the part of the application that handles the logic for processing a web request and returning a web response. There are three main types of views in Django:

1. Function-Based Views (FBV)
These are Python functions that take a request object and return a response object.
Simple and straightforward for small applications or specific tasks.

Example:
from django.http import HttpResponse
def my_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, this is a function-based view!")


  
2. Class-Based Views (CBV)
These are classes that inherit from Djangoâ€™s View class or its subclasses.
Better for organizing code and reusing logic via inheritance and mixins.

Example:
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View
class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, this is a class-based view!")


  
3. Generic Class-Based Views
These are pre-built class-based views provided by Django to handle common patterns like:
1.Displaying a list (ListView)
2.Displaying a detail page (DetailView)
3.Handling forms (CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView)

Example:
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Article
class ArticleListView(ListView):
    model = Article
    template_name = "articles/list.html"



WHEN 2 USE?
FBV..................Simple function, returns HTTP response	Simple or quick views
CBV..................Class with get, post, etc. methods When code reuse or organization is needed
Generic CBV..........Predefined views like ListView, DetailView	CRUD operations, DRY principle
